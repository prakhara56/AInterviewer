Results show large negative effects across many dimensions. Due to \nCOVID-19: 13% of students have delayed graduation,  40% lost a job, internship, or a job offer, \nand 29% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly heterogeneous. One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4\n hours per week due to \nCOVID-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This \nheterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides; lower-income  students are 55% \nmore likely to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19 than their higher-income peers. Finally, \nwe show that the economic and health related shocks induced by COVID-19 vary systematically  \nby socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and \nheterogeneous) \neffects of the pandemic.

        "page_content": "Anecdotal evidence paints a bleak picture for both students and universities. According to the American Council on Education, enrollment is likely to drop by 15% in the fall of 2020,\nwhile at the same time many institutions may have to confront demands for large tuition cuts if classes\nremain virtual.1 In a similar vein, students face an increasingly uncertain environment, where \ufb01nancial and\nhealth shocks (for example, lack of resources to complete their studies or fear of becoming seriously sick),\nalong with the transition to online learning may have a\ufb00ected their academic performance, educational plans,\ncurrent labor market participation, and expectations about future employment. This paper attempts to shed light on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students. First,\nwe describe and quantify the causal e\ufb00ects of the COVID-19 outbreak on a wide set of students\u2019 out-\ncomes/expectations. In particular, we analyze enrollment and graduation decisions, academic performance,\nmajor choice, study and social habits, remote learning experiences, current labor market participation,\nand expectations about future employment. Second, we study how these e\ufb00ects di\ufb00er along existing so-\ncioeconomic divides, and whether the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities. Finally, we present\nsuggestive evidence on the mechanisms behind the heterogeneous COVID-19 e\ufb00ects by quantifying the role\nof individual-level \ufb01nancial and health shocks on academic decisions and labor market expectations. For this purpose, we surveyed about 1,500 undergraduate students at Arizona State University (ASU),\none of the largest public universities in the United States, in late April 2020. The fact that ASU is a large\nand highly diverse institution makes our \ufb01ndings relevant for most public institutions in the country. The\nsurvey was explicitly designed to not only collect student outcomes and expectations after the onset of the\npandemic, but also to recover counterfactual outcomes in the absence of the outbreak. Speci\ufb01cally, the survey\nasked students about their current experiences/expectations and what those experiences/expectations would\nhave been had it not been for the pandemic. Because we collect information conditional on both states of\nthe world (with the COVID-19 pandemic, and without) from each student , we can directly analyze how\neach student believes COVID-19 has impacted their current and future outcomes. 2 For example, by asking\nstudents about their current GPA in a post-COVID-19 world and their expected GPA in the absence of\nCOVID-19, we can back out the subjective treatment e\ufb00ect of COVID-19 on academic performance. The\ncredibility of our approach depends on: (1) students having well-formed beliefs about outcomes in the\ncounterfactual scenario. This is a plausible assumption in our context since the counterfactual state is a\n1See, the New York Times article \u201cAfter Coronavirus, Colleges Worry: Will Students Come Back?\u201d(April 15, 2020) for a\ndiscussion surrounding students\u2019 demands for tuition cuts. 2In some cases, instead of asking students for the outcomes in both states of the world, we directly ask for the di\ufb00erence. For example, the survey asked how the pandemic had a\ufb00ected the student\u2019s graduation date. 2"

        "page_content": "realistic and relevant one - it was the status quo less than two months before the survey, and (2) there being\nno systematic bias in the reporting of the data - an assumption that is implicitly made when using any\nsurvey data.3\nOur \ufb01ndings on academic outcomes indicate that COVID-19 has led to a large number of students delaying\ngraduation (13%), withdrawing from classes (11%), and intending to change majors (12%). Moreover,\napproximately 50% of our sample separately reported a decrease in study hours and in their academic\nperformance. The data also show that while all subgroups of the population have experienced negative\ne\ufb00ects due to the outbreak, the size of the e\ufb00ects is heterogeneous. For example, compared to their higher-\nincome counterparts, lower-income students (those with below-median parental income) are substantially\nmore likely to delay graduation. Finally, we \ufb01nd that students report a decrease in their likelihood of taking\nonline classes as a result of their recent experiences. These e\ufb00ects are, however, more than 150% larger for\nhonors students, suggesting that, a priori, most engaged students strongly prefer in-person classes. As expected, the COVID-19 outbreak also had large negative e\ufb00ects on students\u2019 current labor market\nparticipation and expectations about post-college labor outcomes. Working students su\ufb00ered a 31% decrease\nin their wages and a 37% drop in weekly hours worked, on average. Moreover, around 40% of students lost\na job, internship, or a job o\ufb00er, and 61% reported to have a family member that experienced a reduction\nin income. The pandemic also had a substantial impact on students\u2019 expectations about their labor market\nprospects post-college. For example, their perceived probability of \ufb01nding a job decreased by almost 20%,\nand their expected earnings when 35 years old (around 15 years from the outbreak) declined by approximately\n2.5%. This last \ufb01nding suggests that students expect the pandemic to have a long-lasting impact on their\nlabor market prospects. We \ufb01nd that the substantial variation in the impact of COVID-19 on students tracked with existing\nsocioeconomic divides. For example, compared to their more a\ufb04uent peers, lower-income students are 55%\nmore likely to delay graduation due to COVID-19 and are 41% more likely to report that COVID-19 impacted\ntheir major choice. Further, COVID-19 nearly doubled the gap between higher- and lower-income students\u2019\nexpected GPA.4 There also is substantial variation in the pandemic\u2019s e\ufb00ect on preference for online learning,\nwith Honors students and males revising their preferences down by more than 2.5 times as much as their\npeers. However, despite appearing to be more disrupted by the switch to online learning, the impact of\nCOVID-19 on Honors students\u2019 academic outcomes is consistently smaller than the impact on non-Honors\nstudents. 3This approach has been used successfully in several other settings, such as to construct career and family returns to\ncollege majors (Arcidiacono et al., 2020; Wiswall and Zafar, 2018), and the causal impact of health on retirement (Shapiro and\nGiustinelli, 2019)\n4The income gap in GPA increased from 0.052 to 0.098 on a 4 point scale. It is signi\ufb01cant at the 1% level in both scenarios."

        "page_content": "Finally, we evaluate the extent to which mitigating factors associated with more direct economic and\nhealth shocks from the pandemic (for example, a family member losing income due to COVID-19, or the\nexpected probability of hospitalization if contracting COVID-19) can explain much of the heterogeneity\nin pandemic e\ufb00ects. We \ufb01nd that both types of shock (economic and health) play an important role in\ndetermining students\u2019 COVID-19 experiences. For example, the expected probability of delaying graduation\ndue to COVID-19 increases by approximately 25% if either a student\u2019s subjective probability of being late on\na debt payment in the following 90 days (a measure of \ufb01nancial fragility) or subjective probability of requiring\nhospitalization conditional on contracting COVID-19 increases by one standard deviation. As expected, the\nmagnitude of health and economic shocks are not homogeneous across the student population. The average\nof the principal component for the economic and health shocks is about 0.3-0.4 standard deviations higher for\nstudents from lower-income families. Importantly, we \ufb01nd that the disparate economic and health impacts\nof COVID-19 can explain 40% of the delayed graduation gap (as well as a substantial part of the gap for\nother outcomes) between lower- and higher-income students. To our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst paper to shed light on the e\ufb00ects of COVID-19 on college students\u2019\nexperiences. The treatment e\ufb00ects that we \ufb01nd are large in economic terms. Whether students are overre-\nacting in their response to the COVID-19 shock is not clear. Individuals generally tend to overweight recent\nexperiences (Malmendier and Nagel, 2016; Kuchler and Zafar, 2019). However, whether students\u2019 subjective\ntreatment e\ufb00ects are \u201ccorrect\u201d in some ex-post sense is beside the point. As long as students are reporting\ntheir subjective beliefs without any systematic bias, it is the perceived treatment e\ufb00ects, not actual ones, \u2013\nregardless of whether they are correct or not \u2013 which are fundamental to understanding choices. For example,\nif students (rightly or wrongly) perceive a negative treatment e\ufb00ect of COVID-19 on the returns to a college\ndegree, this belief will have an impact on their future human capital decisions (such as continuing with their\neducation, choice of major, etc.). Our results underscore the fact that the COVID-19 shock is likely to exacerbate socioeconomic disparities\nin higher education. This is consistent with \ufb01ndings regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on K-12 students. Kuhfeld et al., 2020 project that school closures are likely to lead to signi\ufb01cant learning losses in math\nand reading. However, they estimate heterogeneous e\ufb00ects, and conclude that high-performing students are\nlikely to make gains."

Like other higher educational institutions in the\nUS, the Spring 2020 semester started in person. However, in early March during spring break, the school\nannounced that instruction would be transitioned online and that students were advised not to return to\ncampus. The study was advertised on the My ASU website, accessible only through the student\u2019s ASU ID and\npassword. Undergraduate students were invited to participate in an online survey about their experiences\nand expectations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, for which they would be paid $10. The study was\nposted during the second to last week of instruction for the spring semester (April 23rd). Our sample size\nwas constrained by the research funds to 1,500 students, and the survey was closed once the desired sample\nsize was reached. We reached the desired sample size within 3 days of posting the survey. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics. It collected data on students\u2019 demographics and family back-\nground, their current experiences (both for academic outcomes and non-academic outcomes), and their\nfuture expectations. Importantly, for the purposes of this study, the survey collected data on what these\noutcomes/expectations would have been in the counterfactual state, without COVID-19. 2.2 Sample\nA total of 1,564 respondents completed the survey. 5 90 respondents were ineligible for the study (such\nas students enrolled in graduate degree programs or diploma programs) and were dropped from the sample. Finally, responses in the 1st and 99th percentile of survey duration were further excluded, leading to a \ufb01nal\nsample size of 1,446."

        "page_content": "The better performance on admission tests could be explained by the high proportion of Honors students\nin our sample (22% compared to 18% in the ASU population). The last four columns of Table 1 show how\nHonors students compare with ASU students and the average college student at a top-10 university. We see\nthat they perform better than the average ASU student (which is expected) and just slightly worse than the\naverage college student at a top-10 university. The share of white Honors students in our sample (60%) is\nhigher than the proportion in the ASU population and much higher than the proportion of white students\nin the top-10 universities. Overall, we believe our sample of ASU students is a reasonable representation of students at other large\npublic schools, while the Honors students may provide insight into the experiences of students at more elite\ninstitutions. 3 Analytic Framework\nWe next outline a simple analytic framework that guides the empirical analysis . Let Oi(COVID -19) be\nthe potential outcome of individual i associated with COVID-19 treatment. We are interested in the causal\nimpact of COVID-19 on student outcomes:\n\u2206i(O) = Oi(COVID -19 = 1) \u2212 Oi(COVID -19 = 0), (1)\nwhere the \ufb01rst term on the right-hand side is student i\u2019s outcome in the state of the world with COVID-19,\nand the second term being student i\u2019s outcome in the state of the world without COVID-19. Recovering\nthe treatment e\ufb00ect at the individual level entails comparison of the individual\u2019s outcomes in two alternate\nstates of the world. With standard data on realizations, a given individual is observed in only one state of the\nworld (in our case, COVID -19 = 1). The alternate outcomes are counterfactual and unobserved. A large\neconometric and statistics literature studies how to identify these counterfactual outcomes and moments of\nthe counterfactual outcomes (such as average treatment e\ufb00ects) from realized choice data (e.g., Heckman\nand Vytlacil, 2005; Angrist and Pischke, 2009; Imbens and Rubin, 2015). Instead, the approach we use in\nthis paper is to directly ask individuals for their expected outcomes in both states of the world. From the\ncollected data, we can then directly calculate the individual-level subjective treatment e\ufb00ect. As an example,\nconsider beliefs about end-of-semester GPA."

For certain\nbinary outcomes in the survey, we directly ask students for the \u2206i. For example, regarding graduation plans,\nwe simply ask a student if the \u2206 i is positive, negative, or zero: \u201cHow has the COVID-19 pandemic a\ufb00ected\nyour graduation plan? [graduate later; graduation plan una\ufb00ected; graduate earlier].\u201d\nThe approach we use in this paper follows a small and growing literature that uses subjective expectations\nto understand decision-making under uncertainty. Speci\ufb01cally, Arcidiacono et al. (2020) and Wiswall and\nZafar (2018) ask college students about their beliefs for several outcomes associated with counterfactual\nchoices of college majors, and estimate the ex-ante treatment e\ufb00ects of college majors on career and family\noutcomes. Shapiro and Giustinelli (2019) use a similar approach to estimate the subjective ex-ante treatment\ne\ufb00ects of health on labor supply. There is one minor distinction from these papers: while these papers\nelicit ex-ante treatment e\ufb00ects, in our case, we look at outcomes that have been observed (for example,\nwithdrawing from a course during the semester) as well as those that will be observed in the future (such\nas age 35 earnings). Thus, some of our subjective treatment e\ufb00ects are ex-post in nature while others are\nex-ante. The soundness of our approach depends on a key assumption that students have well-formed expectations\nfor outcomes in both the realized state and the counterfactual state. Since the outcomes we ask about are\nabsolutely relevant and germane to students, they should have well-formed expectations for the realized state. In addition, given that the counterfactual state is the one that had been the status quo in prior semesters\n(and so students have had prior experiences in that state of the world), their ability to have expectations for\noutcomes in the counterfactual state should not be a controversial assumption. 6\n4 Empirical Analysis\n4.1 Treatment E\ufb00ects\nWe start with the analysis of the aggregate-level treatment e\ufb00ects, which are presented in Table 2. The\noutcomes are organized in two groups, academic and labor market (see Appendix Table A1 for a complete\nlist of outcomes). The \ufb01rst two columns of the table show the average beliefs for those outcomes where the\nsurvey elicited beliefs in both states of the world. The average treatment e\ufb00ects shown in column (3) are of\nparticular interest."

For example, the average\nsubjective treatment e\ufb00ect of COVID-19 on semester-level GPA is a decline of 0.17 points. More than 50%\nof the students in our sample expect a decrease in their GPA due to the treatment (versus only 7% expecting\nan increase). Additionally, on average, 13% of the participants delayed their graduation, 11% withdrew from\na class during the spring semester, and 12% stated that their major choice was impacted by COVID-19. An\ninteresting and perhaps unanticipated result is that, on average, students are 4 percentage points less likely\nto enroll in an online class given their experience with online instruction due to the pandemic. 7,8 However,\nthere is a substantial amount of variation in terms of the direction of the e\ufb00ect: 31% (47%) of the participants\nare now more (less) likely to enroll in online classes. We explore this heterogeneity in more detail in the\nnext section, but it seems that prior experience with having taken online classes somewhat ameliorates the\nnegative experience: the average treatment e\ufb00ect for students with prior experience with online classes is a\n2.4 percentage points decrease in their likelihood of enrolling in online classes, versus a 9.5 percentage points\ndecline for their counterparts (di\ufb00erence statistically signi\ufb01cant at the 0.1% level). This large variation in the treatment e\ufb00ects of COVID-19 is apparent in several of the other outcomes,\nsuch as study hours, where the average treatment e\ufb00ect of COVID-19 on weekly study hours is -0.9 (that is,\nstudents spend 0.9 less hours studying per week due to COVID-19). The interquartile range of the across-\nsubject treatment e\ufb00ect demonstrates substantial variation, with the pandemic decreasing study time by 5\nhours at the 25th percentile and increasing study time by 4 hours at the 75th. Overall, these results suggest that COVID-19 represents a substantial disruption to students\u2019 academic\nexperiences, and is likely to have lasting impacts through changes in major/career and delayed gradua-\ntion timelines. Students\u2019 negative experiences with online teaching, perhaps due to the abruptness of the\ntransition, also has implications for the willingness of students to take online classes in the future. Turning to Panel B in Table 2, we see that students\u2019 current and expected labor market outcomes were\nsubstantially disrupted by COVID-19. As for the extensive margin of current employment, on average, 29%\nof the students lost the jobs they were working at prior to the pandemic (67% of the students were working\nprior to the pandemic), 13% of students had their internships or job o\ufb00ers rescinded, and 61% of the students\nreported that a close family member had lost their job or experienced an income reduction. The last statistic\nis in line with \ufb01ndings from other surveys of widespread economic disruption across the US. 9 Respondents\n7The questions that were asked to elicit this were: \u201c Suppose you are given the choice to take a course online/remote or\nin-person.

Without\nCOVID-19, lower-income students expected a 0.052 lower semester GPA than their higher-income peers. With COVID-19, this gap nearly doubles to 0.098. 12\nSecond, Panel (d) of Figure 1 shows that the switch to online learning was substantially harder for some\ndemographic groups; for example, men are 7 percentage points less likely to opt for an online version of a\ncourse as a result of the COVID-19 treatment, while women do not have a statistically signi\ufb01cant change in\ntheir online preferences. We also see that Honors students revise their preferences by more than 2.5 times\nthe amount of non-Honors students. As we show later (in Table 4), these gaps persist after controlling\nfor household income, major, and cohort, suggesting that the switch to online learning mid-semester may\nhave been substantially more disruptive for males and Honors students. While the e\ufb00ect of COVID-19 on\npreferences for online learning looks similar for males and Honors students, our survey evidence indicates\nthat di\ufb00erent mechanisms underpin these shifts. Based on qualitative evidence, it appears that Honors\nstudents had a negative reaction to the transition to online learning because they felt less challenged, while\nmales were more likely to struggle with the learning methods available through the online platform. 13 One\nspeculative explanation for the gender di\ufb00erence is that consumption value of college amenities is higher for\nmen (however, Jacob et al. (2018), \ufb01nd little gender di\ufb00erence in willingness to pay for the amenities they\nconsider). The third trend worth highlighting from Figure 1 is that Honors students were better able to mitigate\nthe negative e\ufb00ect of COVID-19 on their academic outcomes (panels a, b, and c), despite appearing to be\nmore disrupted by the move to online learning (panel d). Honors students report being less than half as\nlikely as non-Honors students to delay graduation and change their major due to COVID-19. Extrapolating\nfrom these patterns provides suggestive evidence that academic impacts for students attending elite schools\u2013\nthe group more comparable to these Honors students\u2013 are likely to have been small relative to the impacts\nfor the average student at large public schools. Finally, the last two panels of Figure 1 present the COVID e\ufb00ect on two labor market expectations and\nshow much less meaningful heterogeneity across demographic groups compared to the academic outcomes\nin previous panels.

Financial shocks are characterized based on whether a student lost\na job due to COVID-19, whether a student\u2019s family members lost income due to COVID-19, the change in\na student\u2019s monthly earnings due to COVID-19, and the likelihood a student will fail to fully meet debt\npayments in the next 90 days. To measure health shocks, we consider a student\u2019s belief about the likelihood\nthat they will be hospitalized if they contract COVID-19, a student\u2019s belief about the likelihood that they\nwill have contracted COVID-19 by summer, and a student\u2019s subjective health assessment.

FinShocki and\nHealthShocki are vectors containing the shock proxies or their principal component. Finally, \u03f5i denotes an\nidiosyncratic shock. The parameters of interest are \u03b12 and \u03b13. A causal interpretation of these parameters hinges on the\nidenti\ufb01cation assumption that FinShocki and HealthShocki are independent of \u03f5i. In our context, we\nbelieve that this assumption is reasonable given that FinShocki and HealthShocki contain variables that\ncapture arguably exogenous changes due explicitly to the COVID-19 outbreak or were determined before the\npandemic began.

These e\ufb00ects are large given that they represent more than half\nof the overall COVID-19 treatment e\ufb00ect for these variables.

In particular, columns (4) and (9) demonstrate that\neconomic and health factors together can explain approximately 40% and 70% of the income gap in COVID-\n19\u2019s e\ufb00ect on delayed graduation and changing major respectively. The gap between Honors and non-Honors\nstudents is likewise reduced by 27% and 39% for the same outcomes. Taken together, these results imply\nthat di\ufb00erences in the magnitude of COVID-19\u2019s economic and health impact can explain a signi\ufb01cant\nproportion of the demographic gaps in COVID-19\u2019s e\ufb00ect on the decision to delay graduation, the decision\nto change major, and preferences for online learning. These results are important and suggest that by\nfocusing on mitigating the economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19, policy makers may be able\nto signi\ufb01cantly prevent COVID-19 from exacerbating existing achievement gaps in higher education. 6 Conclusions\nThis paper provides the \ufb01rst systematic analysis of the e\ufb00ects of COVID-19 on higher education. To\nstudy these e\ufb00ects, we surveyed 1,500 students at Arizona State University, and present quantitative evidence\nshowing the negative e\ufb00ects of the pandemic on students\u2019 outcomes and expectations. For example, we \ufb01nd\nthat 13% of students have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Expanding upon these results, we show\nthat the e\ufb00ects of the pandemic are highly heterogeneous, with lower-income students 55% more likely to\ndelay graduation compared to their higher-income counterparts. We further show that the negative economic\nand health impacts of COVID-19 have been signi\ufb01cantly more pronounced for less advantaged groups, and\nthat these are partially responsible for the underlying heterogeneity in the impacts that we document. Our\nresults suggest that by focusing on addressing the economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19, as\nmeasured by a relatively narrow set of mitigating factors, policy makers may be able to prevent COVID-19\nfrom widening existing achievement gaps in higher education. 14"
